## Introduction

Our  event management and promotion website  is called Deventos. Anyone can create or search for events that they want to host or attend. Events include everything from concerts to birthday celebrations to holiday gatherings. Events might take place in person or online. Deventos' goal is to enable its users to take part in planned events without worrying about anything.

## Manage Events
On the Manage my events page, logged-in users can update event specifics or delete their events. Events in this menu can be sorted, and it shows pertinent data like how many tickets are still available overall and how much money was made from ticket sales. If no tickets have been created for an event yet, it is indicated as incomplete; otherwise, it is marked as past.
